# Maps

## Description
A personal project wherein the aim of the minimum viable product is to show an animated timeline of where I have lived throughout my life. The new technologies which are being used is a practice of how to intigrate amCharts with Typescript to create this functionality using the modules and classes provided by the amChart libraries.

## Progression
This started as a practice for API with maps which I initially had, however I wanted to tackle animations in typescript and I found there was no need for the Google Maps API. So it evolved ino a practice with using amCharts after which new concepts are being tackled and are briefly touched on in 'next steps'.

## Current Status 
Working on getting core functionality set up, after which the animation of planes to travel from points A to B will be created. 

### Next steps
Start adding API calls to get real time flight information.
